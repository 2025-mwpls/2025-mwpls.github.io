# 2025 Midwest Programming Language Summit

Saturday, December 13, 2025

[University of Minnesota](https://umn.edu),
[Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.umn.edu)

The [Midwest PL Summit](https://mwpls.org) is an informal workshop to
foster the exchange of ideas and to promote collaboration among
faculty and students in the Greater Midwest area. Anyone interested in
programming languages and compilers — including applications to areas
such as systems, software engineering, and human-computer interaction
— is welcome to attend. Our aim is to have a broad selection of talks
and posters about ongoing research and any other topics that may be of
interest to the PL community. There will be no formal proceedings, but
abstracts and slides will be distributed on the web after the
workshop.

Organizers: 
[Favonia](https://favonia.org/), 
[Gopalan Nadathur](https://cs.umn.edu/~ngopalan), and
